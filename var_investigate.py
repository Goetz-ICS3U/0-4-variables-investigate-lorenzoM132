    + f"One of the questions on the test was whether or not I thought Elvis was cool, so I obviously put {is_cool} to get the answer right... "
    + f"Turns out that I only scored a {math_test_score} on the test. One of the qusetions was asking me to write the equation for a line "
    + f"with a slope of {slope} and a y-intercept of {y_intercept} so I wrote y = {slope}x + {y_intercept}, but I did not notice the x value of {x} in the question "
    + f"so I needed to, on the next line, say that the value of y was {y}. "
    + f"I told my friend {friend_name} about this and he just laughed at me 🙄 "
    + f"As I got home, I called my best friend {best_friend} and we decided to play {favorite_game}. "
    + f"While I was {favorite_hobby}, {best_friend} asked me about the math test but he was very understanding and complimented me for my smarts and I was really happy. "
    + "Anyway, that's the story of my math test."
